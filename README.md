# year-30
Help me think of 30 things to do to celebrate turning 30 in 2016!

Hello! My name is Katelyn, and I'm turning 30 on January 13, 2016. Inspired by a friend's idea to do 40 things in the year that he turns 40, I want to come up with 30 things to do when I turn 30!

These things can be great or small. For example, I know that I want to go backpacking, complete a Tough Mudder race, and go on a train ride across the country. What else should I do? That's a lot of big stuff, so feel free to throw some small ideas at me too.

If you'd like to contribute, make a pull request on the 30-list file and add your ideas! I don't really have any rules for this, just looking to open source some ideas. If I don't include your idea, it's either because it wasn't feasible for me (likely due to time or money), or it wasn't quite up my alley. That said, I'm open to a lot of new experiences!

I plan to complete everything on the list between January 1 and December 31, 2016.
